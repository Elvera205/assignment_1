            <hr>
            <h4> The internet is a global network of interconnected computers, servers, phones, and smart appliances that communicate with each other using trasmission</h4>
        <p> 
            computers are connected dto a aspecific server that retrieves information and sends it to the computers
            They make use of protocols such as the ICP, IP, HTTP. All internet connected computers and other devices can interprete and understand these protocols.
            searhing on a browser will push a query command to the ISP.
            Then the Web browser will start indexing the URL that you have entered and will fetch the details in numeric format
            The server will then send the data and also send a copy of the website on the users sysytem 
            Onces all the data is recieved on the users end, the server will start arranging all the basic information and later form a collective file.
            then you will be able to see the content of that website.
